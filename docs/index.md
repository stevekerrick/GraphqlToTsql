# Welcome!

## An easier way to do GraphQL!

`GraphqlToTsql` 


* NO servers to install
* NO resolvers to write
* NO new technologies to add to your stack

`GraphqlToTsql` is a .NET component that helps you build a `GraphQL` API endpoint.

`GraphqlToTsql` turns `GraphQL` queries into efficient SQL.

`GraphqlToTsql` is a `NuGet` package, not a system or a service. *You* supply
the API endpoint, *you* apply your own authentication.

OR... Use `GraphqlToTsql` as a Micro ORM for your own data layer.

## How does it work?

`GraphqlToTsql` translates a `GraphQL` query into a single
`T-SQL SELECT` query, and executes the query on your `SQL Server` or
`SQL Azure` database.

You write Entity Mappers, so you are in control of which data is
exposed and how things are named.

Your Entity Mappers can include custom join criteria, virtual tables,
and computed values.

## Will GraphqlToTsql fit your needs?

* `GraphqlToTsql` is a .NET component
* `GraphqlToTsql` creates `T-SQL` commands, so your database must be `SQL Server` or `SQL Azure`
* `GraphqlToTsql` only supports the `query` portion of `GraphQL`. `Mutations` are not
supported
